# Overview

Your task is to implement a **Loan Risk Scoring Engine** from scratch.
You can find the requirements in the file `doc/requirements.md`

# Tasks

## Planning

- create a detailed plan for implementing and testing the project
- write your plan to a markdown file and use that to track your progress

### Plan Structure

- you should implement the project in many small steps
- after each step, you must test your changes e.g. with `./mvnw test`
- once the tests are passing, commit your changes e.g. with `git commit`

## Implementation

In general, you should test early and often. Please follow this approach:
- implement the changes for a single step
- write tests
- IMPORTANT: test your changes!!!
    - run the tests with `./mvnw test`
    - fix any issues
    - keep running the tests and fixing until all the tests pass
- commit your changes to git once the tests are passing with `git commit`
- go to the next step

## Wrapping Up

- Please document the project in a README.md
- commit and push your changes once you're done

# Orchestration

Because this is a complex implementation, you should break down the implementation into smaller steps and delegate to the appropriate modes e.g. Architect, Code, etc.

1. start by asking the Architect to
    - plan the implementation and necessary steps
    - ensure the architect plans to RUN the tests after each step
2. review the list of tasks from the architect
3. delegate the tasks to the appropriate mode for execution

# Testing

I can't stress how important is that you run the tests after each step of the plan!
